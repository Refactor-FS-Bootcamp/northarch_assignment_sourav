# Steps to Submit your solution :

- Clone (or pull) the repositary in your local pc.
```
git clone <repo_link>
git pull
```
- Once you have built your project, and made sure it is in a working state:
- Add all the files to the staging area :
```
git add .
```
-  Once all the files are in the staging area, commit your task, with a message (should signify the changes):
```
git commit -m "Completed all tasks"
```
- Once you have commited your changes, you should push all the changes from your local repositary to your github repo.
```
git push origin main
```

THATS ALL! You have successfully submitted your task.
